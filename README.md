The Port Monitoring Tool is a shell-based utility designed to monitor open ports on a system in real-time. It periodically scans the network ports and detects changes, such as newly opened ports or previously open ports that have closed. This tool helps system administrators identify unauthorized services or suspicious activity on a server.
