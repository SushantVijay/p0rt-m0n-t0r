<p id="description">The Port Monitoring Tool is a lightweight shell script that monitors open ports on a system in real-time. It helps detect changes in port activity such as newly opened or closed ports and provides alerts for suspicious or unauthorized behavior. This tool is ideal for system administrators and security enthusiasts to enhance network monitoring and improve system security.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>
